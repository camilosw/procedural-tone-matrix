# Procedural ToneMatrix

This is a procedural music generator based on [ToneMatrix by Audiotool](https://tonematrix.audiotool.com/), wich was originally written in Flash. This project use parts of code from [ToneMatrix Redux](https://github.com/MaxLaumeister/ToneMatrixRedux), an HTML5 revival of that previous project.
